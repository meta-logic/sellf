Thank you for downloading SELLF :)

I) Requirements:

These tools must be installed for 'sellf' to work.
- ocaml, ocamldoc (http://caml.inria.fr/)
- ocamlgraph (http://ocamlgraph.lri.fr/index.en.html)
- dlv (http://www.dlvsystem.com/dlv/)

NOTE: The system is implemented and tested in Linux/Fedora and MacOS. 

II) Installation:

Execute the installation script:

./install.sh

It will create a binary called 'sellf' in the current directory. To start the
program, execute this binary. It also creates a documentation of the main
modules implemented. This is a pdf file in the folder 'doc'.

III) Syntax

The operators of linear logic with subexponentials and its syntax are:

tensor -> *
plus   -> +
with   -> &
par    -> |
!l     -> [l]bang
?l     -> [l]?
one    -> one
zero   -> zero
top    -> top
bottom -> bot

To comment some line in your file, start it with the symbol '%'.
Signature files have sufix '.sig' and the program file has sufix '.pl' (both
must have the same name).

IV) Running:

After compilation, an executable file called 'sellf' will be created in the
current folder. To execute it, just type:

./sellf

and press enter. A command line prompt will appear with the symbol ':>'. For a
list of commands available, you can type '#help'. 

Some example specifications can be found inside the 'examples/proofsystems'
folder. If you open the file 'mall.pl' you can see the specification of
multiplicative additive linear logic (MALL). A specification rule has the
following form:

(not (rght (tensor A B))) * (([lr]? (rght A)) * ([lr]? (rght B))).

Some buit-in elements for the specification of systems are:

- 'form' as the type of formulas of the object logic
- 'term' as the type of terms of the object logic
- atomic predicates 'rght' and 'lft' of type form -> o

A specification can be built of formulas using these operators and the
predicates 'rght' or 'lft' that atomizes formulas of the object logic. They are
also divided in four sections which are identified by the keywords: 'rules
introduction', 'rules axiom', 'rules cut' and 'rules structural'.

To load the file 'mall.pl' of the examples folder, run 'sellf' as expalined above
and type:

#load examples/proofsystems/mall

Then, the system will display a 'mall >' symbol indicating that the file is loaded.
The commands available at this point can be seen using the command '#help'. 

Alternatively, a file can be loaded directly from the command line:

./sellf -i examples/proofsystems/mall
