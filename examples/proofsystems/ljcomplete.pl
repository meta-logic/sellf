% Adequacy on the level of derivations

% The sequents will be Gamma |- Delta 
% where Gamma and Delta are multi-sets of formulas (linear)
% and Delta contains at most one formuls at all times.
% The fact that sometimes the context is copied and sometimes 
% it is split is encoded in the rules themselves.
