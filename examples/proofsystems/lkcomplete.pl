% The sequents will be Gamma |- Delta 
% where Gamma and Delta are multi-sets of formulas (linear).
% The fact that sometimes the context is copied and sometimes 
% it is split is encoded in the rules themselves.

% Conjunction additive
not (lft (andNeg A B)) * ?[l] (lft A) + ?[l] (lft B).
not (rght (andNeg A B)) * ?[r] (rght A) & ?[r] (rght B).

% Conjunction multiplicative
not (lft (andPos A B)) * ?[l] (lft A) | ?[l] (lft B).
not (rght (andPos A B)) * ?[r] (rght A) * ?[r] (rght B).

% Disjunction additive
