EBL LaTeX class
===============

This is the official LaTeX class to generate abstracts to the 
Book of Abstracts of the Brazilian Logic Conference 2014.
Please download the following files and place them in the same 
folder where your LaTeX and BibTeX files are saved:

 - ebl.cls: EBL LaTeX class file (responsible by format definitions of your article)
 - ebl.bst: EBL BibTeX style file (responsible by formatting your bibliographical references)
 - abstract_template.tex: example LaTeX file of EBL LaTeX class and BibTeX style usage
 - ref.bib: example BibTeX file

To use it in your LaTeX file take in concern the following 
guidelines where commands are identified between quotes.

1) The first line of your LaTeX file must be "\documentclass{ebl}".

2) After this first line you must complete the preamble of your file 
with some options:

- If you need to use any package (e.g. amsmath) include it as 
in "\usepackage{amsmath}";
- The title (e.g. My title) of your work must be placed as 
in "\title{My title}";
- The name of the authors (e.g. John and Mary) must be identified 
as in "\author{John\inst{1} \and Mary\inst{2}}", where the 
command "\inst{1}" means that the precedent author is affiliated 
with the first institution declared (as in the following instruction);
- The institution names must be declared with as in the 
command "\institute{John's Department\\John's University\email{John's 
eMail}\nextinstitution Mary's Department\\Mary's 
University\email{Mary's eMail}}" (if there is another author 
just repeat from "\nextinstitute").

3) After the preamble you must begin your document with 
the command "\begin{document}".

4) At this point you must place the command "\maketitle", 
that will use the previous information to generate the headings 
of your work.

5) Now you must insert the text of your work.

6) If you have bibliographic references you shoul construct 
a BibTeX file (we strongly recommend the use of JabRef to manage 
your references and construct your BibTeX file, freely available 
at http://jabref.sf.net ) and, for a BibTeX file named ref, you 
should include the command "\bibliography{ref}".

7) Finish your document with the command "\end{document}".
