After checking out the tatu directory into some folder, you should create a
folder called sellf with the directories 'src' and 'examples' from the
repository. Then you create a symbolic link called 'sellf.bin' on the top level
folder ponting to 'sellf/src/sellf'. Also, you need to create a folder called
'proofsTex' on the top level and make this and 'files' readable, writable and
executable for all.
