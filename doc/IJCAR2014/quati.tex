The proof of many foundational results in structural proof theory, such as the
admissibility of the cut rule and the completeness of the focusing discipline,
rely on permutation lemmas. It is often a tedious and error prone task to prove
such lemmas as they involve many cases. This paper describes the tool Quati
which can automatically prove
%is an automated tool capable of proving 
a wide range of inference rule
permutations for a wide number of sequent calculus proof systems. Given a proof system
specification in the form of a theory in linear logic with subexponentials,
Quati outputs in \LaTeX\ the permutation transformations for which it was able
to prove correcteness and also the 
possible derivations for which it was not able to do so. As illustrated in this
paper, Quati's output is very similar to proof derivation figures one would
normally find in a proof theory book.

\section{Introduction}

Permutation lemmas play an important role in proof theory. Many foundational
results about sequent calculus proof systems rely on the fact that some rules
permute over others. The most well-known of those is probably the admissibility of
the cut rule, which was proved for the systems \textbf{LK} and \textbf{LJ} by
Gentzen in 1934 \cite{gentzen}, and until today the same method is used to prove
cut elimination of various systems. Other important results that rely on the
permutability of rules are the mid-sequent theorem (or Herbrand's theorem)
\cite{herbrand} and the completeness of proof search strategies such as uniform
provability \cite{} and focusing \cite{andreoli}. Nevertheless, it is hard to
find complete proofs of these results with all the permutation cases listed.

As an example, consider the case of permuting $\vee_l$ over $\rightarrow_l$ in
the intuitionistic calculus \textbf{LJ}. In order to show whether these two
rules permute, one needs to check \emph{every possible case} in which
$\rightarrow_l$ occurs above $\vee_l$ in a derivation. When using a
multiplicative calculus, there are four possibilities for such derivation, two
allow a permutation of the rules while the other two don't\footnote{In an
additive calculus there are three possibilities, only one of them allow a
permutation.}. Here's one of each:

  \deduce{\Gamma, P \vdash F}{\varphi_1\vspace{0.2cm}}
  &
  \infer[\rightarrow_l]{\Gamma', \Gamma'', A \rightarrow B , Q \vdash F}{
    \deduce{\Gamma' \vdash A}{\varphi_2\vspace{0.2cm}}
    &
    \deduce{\Gamma'', Q, B \vdash F}{\varphi_3\vspace{0.2cm}}
  }

    \deduce{\Gamma, P \vdash F}{\varphi_1\vspace{0.2cm}}

    \deduce{\Gamma', Q \vdash A}{\varphi_2\vspace{0.2cm}}
    &

The combinatorial nature of permutation lemmas can be observed in this example.
While this illustrates only one case, proving the focusing discipline, for
instance, requires that the permutation of every pair of rules is checked. For a
system with $n$ rules, this amounts to $2^n$ cases.

The checking of all cases is a tedious task which can be error prone. And the
fact that the cases are rarely documented makes it hard for others to check the
correctness of the transformations. The cut-elimination result for
bi-intuitionistic logic, for example, given by Rauszer \cite{rauszer74studia}
was later found to be incorrect \cite{crolard01tcs} exactly because one of the
permutation lemmas was not true. An automated tool to check for these lemmas
would be therefore of great help.

In this paper we describe such a tool. Section \ref{sec:checking} explains
briefly the theoretical background that was implemented. Section \ref{sec:quati}
describes the actual implementation and explains, with an example, how to use
it. Section \ref{sec:conclusion} summarizes the results obtained and point the
directions of future work.
