\begin{itemize}
    \item The predicates that identify object-level formulas ($\lfloor \cdot
    \rfloor$ and $\lceil \cdot \rceil$) are \texttt{lft} and \texttt{rght}.
    \item If a connective $\diamond$ is introduced on the left by two rules which are
    specified as $B_{l1}$ and $B_{l2}$, than it is stored as $B_{l1}
    \oplus B_{l2}$.
\end{itemize}
